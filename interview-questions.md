# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a code management software. Git is software and Github is the technology that runs git. 

  Researched answer: Git is a software that is in charge of monitoring the changes in software code, whose original code is available to be modified by other users. The main difference between the two is that Github is closed source, while Git is open source. The other difference is that Git is software, whereas Github is a cloud service that hosts Git.  



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: <, >, <=, >=, ==, ===, !=, ||, &&

  Researched answer: Logical operators test for true or false and return a Boolean value. 



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a specific location of an element within an object. A value specifies an input and would be the equivalent to said object. 

  Researched answer: Index represents the location of an element within a value. An example would be the letter "d" in the word "index". It is the third letter in the word. As such, its index would be 3, for its location within the word. The word "index" would be considered a value. The letters of the word would be considered elements. The location of those letters, within the word, would be considered indexes.  



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An execution of a process

  Researched answer: The process of repeating steps, in an attempt to improve application or reach a specific end result. Alpha and Beta testing would be practical examples of human iterations. An application is reviewed and tested by users, repeatedly, until a satisfactory product is produced.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques involve users performing separate roles in tandem, to reach a goal. The roles are navigator and driver. The navigator applies code logic to a problem and the driver, tests, executes and gives feedback on that logic to the navigator. Proper technique also involves uses swapping roles frequently and communicating feedback.

  Researched answer: The roles of pair programming are comprised of the driver and the navigator. The driver writes the code. The navigator reviews each line of code. The users work together to keep eachother on task. They apply multiple solutions to a problem and communicate to select the better method. They swtich roles often and are usually of different skill levels in programming.

3. Objects: An element with a property and a data type. 

4. Method: A function that can be performed on an object.
